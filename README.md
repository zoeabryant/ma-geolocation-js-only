## Geolocation tracking
This is sample code to help with our final project at Makers Academy.

Proof of concept on being able to track users using only JS.

Our final project is **Mist**: an app that informs users as to whom they almost bumped in to on the previous day. The project code is located [here](https://github.com/HanWax/so_close)

**None of this code is test driven**. The code in this repo is purely exploratory. It [reeks](https://github.com/joenas/preek).

## Conclusion

I wrote this example to prove that we can track our users if they move, using only JS.

This code updates the page with your longitude and latitude if it detects you have moved location.

We did not use this code in the final project. In order to use this code we would have had to ensure the script could run on a users phone in the background as they moved around. Creating native phone apps was out of the scope of what we had learnt in the past 10 weeks. We chose to use an API from another app which tracks your movements for us instead, for ease of development.
